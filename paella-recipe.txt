Directions
Ideally, cook this recipe on your grill. If grilling is not an option, start the recipe on your cooktop and finish it in the oven at 375. If cooking indoors, preheat your oven.
Add turmeric, saffron, pimenton, oregano, salt and pepper to your stock and set aside. Heat the oil in an 8 person seasoned paella pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until transparent but not brown. Add the garlic and cook until softened but not brown. Add the chorizo and cook for about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the peppers and tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium; add the rice and sauté for 5 minutes. Pour in the stock that has been combined with your dry seasonings. Stir once, but DO NOT STIR any more. If grilling, close the lid to your grill. If cooking indoors, transfer your paella pan to your preheated oven. Cook for 15 minutes. Add the Serrano ham, shrimp, and parsley. Cook for 10 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender.
